The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. 
The JVM has two primary functions: to allow Java programs to run on any device or operating system (known as the "Write once, run anywhere" principle), 
and to manage and optimize program memory.

JVM architecture includes Class Loader, Memory Area (Method Area, Heap, Stack, PC Registers, Native Method Stack), Execution Engine (Interpreter, JIT Compiler), and Native Interface.

Garbage Collection (GC) in JVM automatically frees up memory by destroying objects that are no longer in use to ensure optimal use of memory.

JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms. The JVM is detailed by a specification that formally describes what is required in a JVM implementation.

The JVM is platform-independent, meaning that the same Java program can run on different operating systems without modification.

It performs the following key functions:
1. Loads code
2. Verifies code
3. Executes code
4. Provides runtime environment

Memory Areas in JVM:
- Method Area
- Heap
- Stack
- PC Registers
- Native Method Stack

Class Loader Subsystem loads, links, and initializes classes and interfaces.
Execution Engine executes the instructions contained in the methods of the class.

The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is a part of the JVM that improves performance by compiling bytecodes into native machine code at runtime.

Garbage Collection is the process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically. It helps to optimize the performance of the application.
